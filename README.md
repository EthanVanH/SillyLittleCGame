# SillyLittleCGame
I dont know man. This is a silly c game im making for fun
its abusing ncurses so its objectively terrible.

Goal: Have a working ncurses version of the game Space invaders.

Space invaders being the game where several "invaders" move across the top then down the screen while "shooting" at the ground, the player will lose the game if hit too many times by the shots from the invaders or if the invaders reach the ground. The longer the game is played the faster the invaders get. Some invaders will not shoot.
